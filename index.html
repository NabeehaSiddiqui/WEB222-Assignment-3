    <h3 id="about">About</h3>
    <p>
      Native to North America, the Red-Spotted admiral, or scientifically known as
      <em>Limenitis arthemis astyanax</em> is a butterfly species in the cosmopolitan genus
      Limenitis. The <abbr class="Acronym">L. Artemis </abbr
      ><dfn class="meaning"> (Limenitis arthemis) </dfn>can be split into two major groups on the
      basis of one physical characteristic: a white band along the wings. This species of butterfly
      is described to be beautiful and highly active. Looks aside, this species of butterfly is in
      constant motion. They tend to fly at lower altitudes and for short durations. When not flying,
      this species is constantly walking over leaves and folding their wings. This species of
      butterfly also enjoys the sun as they are commonly found resting at the highest points on
      trees.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to the Red-Spotted admiral, is the White-Spotted admiral - scientifically known as
      <em>Limenitis arthemis arthemis</em>. Both butterflies share similairites in all aspects,
      however, the White-Spotted admiral has a more prominent presence of white on it's wings.

        <strong>Adults</strong>: <strong>Red-Spotted Admiral - </strong>Wingspan of adults tend to
        be around 3.0 to 3.5 inches. The wings are black with thin marginal white dashes with spots
        of orange. <br /><strong>White-Spotted Admiral - </strong> Wingspan is usually the same as
        the Red-Spotted Admiral, however, this butterfly tends to have more noticeable displays of
        white on it's wings.

      Preferred plants as hosts in Florida are <abbr class="Acronym">black cherry</abbr

    </p>
    <h3 id="habitat">Habitat</h3>
    <p>
      The Limenitis Arthemis are found within North America. These butterflies tend to be found in
      woodlands and within the edges of the forest in shady areas.

    <h3 id="food">Food</h3>
    <p>
      Caterpillars tend to feed on yellow birch trees including Betula aleghaniensis and Betula
      lenta. Adult butterflies tend to feed on rotting druit and nectar from small white flowers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="lifecyc">Life Cycle</h3>
    <p>
      Eggs last for about 7 days. After hatching, the caterpillars or
      <abbr class="Acronym"> L. arthemis </abbr
      ><dfn class="meaning"> (Limenitis arthemis) </dfn> larvae have brown heads and dark brown and
      yellow bordered bodies. The pupa stage lasts 10-14 days. Past the pupa stage, adult life of
      these butterflies last around 6-14 days.

    <h3 id="ovrwint">Overwintering</h3>
    <p>
      The Red-spotted Purple <a href="#over" class="gloss">overwinters</a> as larva. The larva born
      in late summer spend the winter in a <a href="#hiber" class="gloss">hibernaculum</a> made from
      a folded leaf.
    </p>
    <h3 id="locate">How to find One</h3>
    <p>
      The <em>White Admiral</em> is found in northern reigons of North America. It is found in
      places like Canada, Alaska and the subaractic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the White and Red-spotted admirals interbreeed in areas such as Minnesota, Pensylvania to
      Maine. Hybrid offsprings tend to have a combination of traits and features from both forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Red-Spotted admiral</em> is found in more southern areas such as below the Great Lakes
      to Floarida. This butterfly is mainly found within the Easter half of the U.S., from
      Pennsylvania to the mid-west. Towards the south it is found in eastern Texas to east Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find both forms, look for them at the edges of boreal or deciduous forests.They are
      commonly seen within forest edges, open fields and scrubby habitats. The Red-Spotted can be
      found along costal plains. The males tend to visit mud puddles.
    </p>
    <h3 id="threats">Major Threats</h3>
    <p>
      Since the life-span of these creatures is short, not alot can be said about predeators.
      However, the biggest threat these creatures face is the impacts of climate change. These
      butterflies choose to reside in woodland areas and with the increasing negative effects of
      climate change, these areas become compromised. The compromisation of their habitat leads to
      dire effects for these creatures in many aspects such as shelter, diet (not having access to
      leaves they feed on).
